# Unixer

Unixer is a terminal via this discord bot. It is incredibly **secure** and has no security flaws, and everything is stored in a local JSON file. It's impenetrable. It has an __elegant and graceful__ interface that is easy to operate, like adding, removing, and listing users.

Setup the bot by putting your ID in the Users.json.

The bot functions by checking your discord ID and if it is in Users.json, and then will be run. Commands can be however long. Unixer deals with them, and it doesn't matter. Due to discords limitations, the output can only be 1024 characters per value. Thanks to the special programming implemented, Unixer can tell how long the output is and react accordingly. It can split up the output up to 4092 characters and set them as values. It preserves the directory, so that's great and you don't need to return.
